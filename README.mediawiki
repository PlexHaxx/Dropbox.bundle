'''Dropbox for Plex''' is a browser channel which enables you to watch and hear your
media directly from the cloud.

Please keep in mind that this channel will '''not transcode''' any content. So you have to make sure
that the content is viewable on your devices. If Plex will support any transcoding of streamed
content in the future, this feature can be implemented afterwards.

=== Your decision ===
This channels supports the '''dropbox''' and '''sandbox''' mode from dropbox. The mode differs
from what this channel can access in your dropbox. '''dropbox''' mode is the god mode which
enables this channel to see all your files. If you'd like to jail this channel to a special
folder, you have to use the '''sandbox''' mode. You have to come to a decision when you'll
create an app within your '''own''' dropbox developer console.

=== Authorize access ===
Select the access mode and get the access token for your Dropbox account at:
[https://tools.schmidt.ps/authDropboxChannel4Plex https://tools.schmidt.ps/authDropboxChannel4Plex]

After validation an access token is displayed which you have to enter within the
channel preferences.

'''Please secure you access token. NOBODY may know it! This token allows full access
to your configured dropbox space.'''

=== My last words ===
Have fun with this little goodie...
